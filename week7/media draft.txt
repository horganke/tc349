Right now my work gallery and hero section are placeholder images. 
I'm envisioning taking full screenshots of the front page of 6 of the 
recent websites I have worked on with my team at SNWorks. Then, my hero image
will be a high resolution version of my resume, clicking on it will open a pdf. 

The media box further down in the text section will actually be a contact form where
those visiting the site can send me a message. The "FOllow" section will really be a list
of icon links to different social media sites.
